## Overview
**CAD-Coder generates CAD code (CadQuery Python) given an image input! Our model is a fine-tuned, open-source vision-langauge foundation model.** 

On a test-set of CAD images, we demonstrate that CAD-Coder out-performs state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source code-generating VLMs both in terms of valid syntax rate of output Python scripts and generated solid accuracy.
